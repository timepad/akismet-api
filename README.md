Akismet-API
===========

Small library to access Akismet API

Usage
=====

Initalizing class

    $connector = new Riv\Service\Akismet\Connector\Curl();
    $akismet = new Riv\Service\Akismet\Akismet($connector);

During initalization, class doesn't verify API key any more. You have to use `$akismet->keyCheck()` to know if it's valid or not. You have to check `$akismet->getError()` to see if there are any errors

Checking API key

    $akismet->keyCheck('api key', 'blog url');

Checking if comment is spam

    $akismet->check(array(
        'permalink' => 'The permanent location of the entry the comment was submitted to',
        'comment_type' => 'May be blank, comment, trackback, pingback, or a made up value like "registration"',
        'comment_author' => 'Name submitted with the comment',
        'comment_author_email' => 'Email address submitted with the comment',
        'comment_author_url' => 'URL submitted with comment',
        'comment_content' => 'The content that was submitted'
    ));

Above function returns `true`, if comment is spam, `false` otherwise. `$akismet->sendSpam()` and `$akismet->sendHam()` works same way.
